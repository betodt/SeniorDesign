\section{Test Plan}
We have divided our test plan into two categories: white box and black box testing. We plan to constantly conduct white box testing throughout project development. Because we have knowledge of our code, we will verify our system through unit testing to ensure that components are behaving correctly. Uniting testing will involve the login and logout process and project creation process. We will test the application\textsc{\char13}s logical flow of tasks based on dependencies between tasks, calendars, and time progression by analyzing our logical path models as well as performing unit testing. In addition, we will conduct black box testing by playing the role of a user and interacting with the system. Furthermore, we will engage in weekly inspections and reviews to examine the software artifact for the purpose of finding errors. \par To test usability, functionality and aesthetics, we will conduct acceptance testing through a series of alpha and beta testing. For alpha testing, we plan to observe users testing the account and project creation process. We will have the list of activities that we will ask the user to perform and then record the user\textsc{\char13}s feedback. In addition, we will conduct beta testing by asking users to use our application for managing their own small projects. After they complete their projects, they will answer survey questions in regards to functionality and user experience.

\section{Project Risks}
Risks threaten the success of our project. Issues are prone to happen during project development, thus we must be prepared when facing adversity. By conducting a risk analysis, we will can identify all possible risks and the impact on our application as a whole. As shown in table \ref{riskAnal}, we have listed each risk and its consequence. Next, we rated the probability from a scale of 0 to 1. In addition, we rated the severity of the risk from a scale of 0 to 10. We then multiplied the probability and severity to determine the risk\textsc{\char13}s impact to our project. After calculating the impact of each risk, we provided two mitigation strategies: one strategy to reduce the probability and another strategy to reduce the severity of the risk.

\section{Development Timeline}
In order to manage our time efficiently, we developed a Gantt chart. A Gantt chart displays the amount of work done or production that is completed in certain periods of time in relation to the amount planned for in such periods. Organization is crucial to the success of this project, thus we assigned each member responsibilities and set concrete deadlines for each responsibility. The following figures show our proposed development timeline.

\section{Societal Issues}
When building a new application, it is important to realize the societal aspects pertaining to the new product. As engineers, we have the ability to influence our users and thus we must act in an ethical manner when designing and developing an application. In order to ensure that we were acting ethically, we referenced the ACM Code of Ethics throughout the process of our application. Below is a ethical justification for our project, as well as how we plan to ensure that we are acting ethically with our team members and during product development. Lastly, we discuss social and cultural issues associatied with Planly. 
\subsection{Ethical Justification for Our Project}
 We selected to build a collabortive project management application because we noticed a need for a management and organizational application for individuals who have multiple commitments in their lives. The moral reason we decided on our project is because we are aware that we live in a society based on productivity. Many individuals are being bombarded with tasks from different organizations, and with the invention of mobile devices, it seems that work never stops. We believe all humans have the right to live a dignified life and should not be stressed to such severity that health-related consequences, such as mental illness, can occur. With the creation of an organizational management application, we hope to relieve stress by providing individuals with an accessible web based interface where they can easily communicate with their team members, find an organized list of their tasks and keep track of their schedules. In addition, we hope that individuals will use our project management app to plan personal projects, such as weddings or birthday parties, thus allowing them to enjoy their lives doing the things that make life memorable. 
 \subsection{Team and Organizational Ethics}
 Our team is composed of two individuals. Practical steps that we have taken to ensure fair treatment among team members is by effectively communicating and negotiating which tasks each member will do. We ensure that we are acting ethically by obeying the ACM Software Engineering Code of Ethics (later explained in the Product Development section) and also by using the SCU’s Ethical Decision Framework when we are unsure of a decision. 
 \subsection{Product Development} 
To ensure that we are acting ethically when developing our product, we followed the ACM Software Engineering Code of Ethics. 

 \begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{|c c|} 
 \hline
 ACM Code Of Ethics & Our Team  \\ [0.5ex] 
 \hline\hline
 Public: Act in the public's interest & When deciding our project, we analyzed who our market is and what their needs are to ensure we acting in the public’s interest. \\ 
 \hline
 2 & 7 & 78 & 5415 \\
 \hline
 3 & 545 & 778 & 7507 \\
 \hline
 4 & 545 & 18744 & 7560 \\
 \hline
 5 & 88 & 788 & 6344 \\ [1ex] 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Social and Cultural Issues}
We have an ethical duty to do no harm to the potential users of our product. When building our system, we will take extremely proactive measures to ensure that their data is safe and secure. We would never release any personal data unless there is legal action in where we will be sure to inform our user before doing so. When conducting product test, we will always provide our testers with a consent form and ensure that they know what they are signing off to. We would never pressure anyone to use our product. A ramification of our product to society as a whole is that while it will help individuals stay organization, it may cause individuals to become too dependent on technology. While we want people to use our product to ease their lives, we hope that they see our tool as an aid rather than a dependency.
