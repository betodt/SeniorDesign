Individuals currently live in a society that revolves around productivity. People from managers to students are bombarded with numerous tasks and daunting deadlines, making it extremely difficult to stay organized. In addition, people have multiple commitments in their lives, adding to the stress of keeping up with their already busy schedules. Currently, people are faced with a variety of organization methods. However, the two tools most people resort to, e-mail and notepad, become a burden to organize over time. In addition, current project management solutions are targeted towards large enterprises and not accessible for the general public. We propose a simple and user-friendly web-based solution that will be accessible to all. With the creation of a project management application, we will allow users to host a collaborative environment by providing them with a web based interface where they can easily communicate with their team members, find an organized list of their tasks and keep track of their schedules. In addition, we want individuals will use our project management application to plan personal projects, such as weddings or birthday parties, thus allowing them to enjoy their lives doing the things that make life memorable.
