\section{Conceptual Models}
In this section, we discuss how some of the main components and processes of our system will function and behave. These models will lay the foundation for the initial development of our system. We included three models to clearly illustrate our vision for the system; an entity relationship diagram, activity diagrams, and a mockup of our primary application view.
\subsection{Entity Relationship Diagram}
An entity relationship diagram describes the types of connections between the main components of the system. Figure \ref{erd} shows us the five primary pieces that makeup our application; projects, teams, team members, a team leader, and project tasks. A project and a team can only have one leader. A project can have many teams, which are composed of many members. Lastly, members can have many tasks. 
A team leader effectively makes the projects. He or she is the person who initially uses the application to enter all the details of the project, including tasks and deadlines. The team leader also invites other members to the application and starts to assign them tasks and even add to them to a team with its own set of subtasks.

\subsection{Activity Diagrams}
An activity diagram is a flowchart of a user’s actions to accomplish a goal. Our first figure, figure \ref{activityOne}, depicts the actions necessary to create a project. Assuming that the user has signed in, the user must name his project, and also define the project’s goal and deadline. Next she will have the option to add team members to the project. (This process will be explained in Figure \ref{activityTwo}).  If he declines to add members, the project creation process is completed.

\end{figure}

\par The next activity diagram, figure \ref{activityTwo}, describes team creation. If the user wishes to add team members of his/her project, he/she must first add a team description. Next, he/she will add a team member by entering his/her email. If the member has an account in our application, he/she will be successfully added to the team. If he/she is not a member, our system will send him/her an email invitation. The user will then have the option to continue adding team members. Lastly, the project creator will assign a project lead role to either him/herself or another member. Once the project lead role is assigned, he/she has completed the team creation process.

\par The next activity diagram, figure \ref{activityFour}, depicts the assignment of  tasks process. The user will select a task and proceed to assign the task to team member(s). After this step, the process is complete.

\subsection{Mockups}

Our final model, the mockup, gives us a rough overview of the layout for the application. The nav bar and left side bar are minimalistic, having only as many features as necessary to accomplish any logistics such as account management and login buttons. The main feature, a blank canvas, will provide users with any interactivity related to the current project they are viewing, including tasks, timelines, and upcoming deadlines.

\section{Use Cases}
A use case defines the steps required to accomplish a specific goal. The following use cases describe how the user interacts with the system to achieve these goals, including preconditions, postconditions, steps required, and common errors that might occur. The use case diagram, Figure \ref{ucd}, helps to illustrate the user’s major actions in our application: creating a project, adding team members, and creating and assigning tasks.

\section{Technologies Used}
In this section, we describe the technologies we chose to develop our application and the features they provide for us.
\begin{enumerate}
\item HTML5 \par The latest version of the standard web markup language
\item JS \par A high-level, untyped, and interpreted programming  language supported by all modern web browser
\item CSS3 \par A stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of HTML documents
\item Ember.js \par A front-end javascript framework based on the model-view-controller (MVC) model and applies programming conventions to build scalable applications
\item  Firebase \par A backend-as-a-service that provides client-side APIs, and services such as databases, web hosting, and authentication.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Design Rationale}
In this section, we describe why we chose these technologies and the advantages and disadvantages associated with each of those technologies. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item HTML5/CSS3 /JS \par This trio of web technologies has become the standard for web development
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Advantages
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Well documented and supported in the development community
			\item Gives the developer control over the look and feel of the application
			\item Compatible with nearly any web browser out there
		\end{enumerate}
		\item Disadvantages
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Without a framework or library it has little functionality
			\item Requires a lot of time and effort to create a complete and robust application
			\item Some browser interpret certain elements differently
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
\item Ember.js \par We chose a framework because it expedites the development process. Ember.js boasts taking its developers 80\% of the way through development with the use of best idioms and proper practices. It is used by companies such as Yahoo, Groupon, and Square.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Advantages
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Faster development start time
			\item Allows the developer to create reusable components through the use Handlebars templates
			\item The built in router allows developers to create multi page applications by navigating the user through states rather than physical webpages, reducing the need to keep track of these different states since the page never physically reloads. 
		\end{enumerate}
		\item Disadvantages
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The framework is based around conventions, limiting developers freedom for a majority of the development process
			\item If the developers do stray from convention, they could find themselves having a difficult time reaching completion
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
\item  Firebase \par We chose this backend service due to the fact that it provides a client-side API for Ember.js called EmberFire.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Advantages
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Using a client-side API eliminates the need for a backend language and allow us to focus on a single language for all of our development.
			\item Firebase also provides hosting and database services for free!
		\end{enumerate}
		\item Disadvantages
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Support is outsourced, we do not have direct access to our server and are at the mercy of whatever functionality is provided by the API
			\item A free firebase account does not provide provide private backups of our data, increasing the probability of data loss
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
